## Lessons Learned

Doing this project i learned how to make a call for API and how to use them, how
to keep my keys secret thanks to a .env file and last but not least how to
initialize a project with webpack.

## API Reference

All the API you need are here [Hacker News](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)

## Environment Variables

In the repo you can find a .env_example file. You have to put your api there and
save the file as .env

## Features

- Responsive design
- 5 different sections of news
- Load more button to read 10 more news each time

## Makin the Project

First of all i started initializing the project with webpack, so once i
installed the dependencies and set the webpack.config file i created all the
content i needed in the template html file.

The next step was to put the API keys into a .env file and with a webpack
plug-in i managed to reach those keys.

After that i created all the necessary functions in the index.js file: one to
call the API and manage the data received, one to display the data as news as we
intend them, one to implement a working button that takes more news. I also
implemented a UnixTime to Date converter to know when the article where
published.

The next step was to modify the style a little bit, to make the site more
beautiful. To accomplish that i used bootstrap, not only for the style, but even
to make the site responsive.

Finally once the app was ready i deployed it with netlify.
